Here, I've built my first, incredibly simple recipe website with HTML. The 
recipes I've shared are from the very talented Ella Wei, who crafted them 
with love and a keen sense of balance.

The pages are horrifically ugly, I can't deny, as they're made only with 
HTML -- no CSS or JS involved yet. Still, it's a proof of concept that I 
can build the basic framework of a webpage. Next, it's time to make things 
a bit more presentable.
