    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>
        Somedays, I could sit and eat cookies until I make myself sick. Thankfully, 
        my partner is an absolute savant in the kitchen, and she blends a passion and 
        skill for baking that ensures our sweets arsenal is always fully stocked, 
        regardless of my late-night munchies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, I'm going to introduce to you the concept of these particular cookies, mainly the fact that they're vegan, lower in sugar, and packed full of goji berries for antioxidant goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I talk about this any longer, I may have to walk away from the keyboard and make some myself.

    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>420 grams all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>70 grams cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flaxseed + 6 tablespoons water &#40;to produce 2 flax eggs&#41;</li>
            <li>140 grams caster sugar</li>
            <li>160 grams coconut or brown sugar</li>
            <li>240 grams cold coconut oil or soft butter</li>
            <li>100 grams chopped dark chocolate</li>
            <li>10 grams goji berries &#40;soaked in water beforehand&#41;</li>
            
        </ul>



    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <p>
            <i>*First, preheat over to 170 degrees celsius</i>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>First, beat up 2 kinds of sugar and cold coconut oil (or soft butter) 
                with a hand mixer until it’s a bit fluffy. Then add flax eggs and 
                beat up until they’re combined.</li>
            <li>Next, sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda. 
                Add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, along with the chopped 
                chocolate and drained goji berries. Use a spatula to mix it up until 
                it’s well combined.</li>
            <li>After everything is mixed well, shape each piece of cookie dough 
                into a 120g ball before slightly pressing the dough before baking.</li>
            <li>Bake at 170 degree celsius for 16 min or until cooked through.</li>

            
        </ol>
